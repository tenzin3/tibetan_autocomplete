# tibetan_autocomplete

"Complete this Tibetan sentence with the single most natural and commonly used ending word or particle: ང་སྐྱིད་པོ་"
This revised prompt:
1. Specifies that you want only the single most natural completion
2. Clarifies you're looking for just the ending word/particle (not multiple options)
3. Maintains context that this is a Tibetan sentence
4. Eliminates the possibility of getting explanations about the phrase
